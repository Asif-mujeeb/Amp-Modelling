# Lightweight Amp Modelling Experiments

## Overview
This project documents my experiments in building lightweight guitar amp models, aiming to reduce CPU usage compared to existing amp sims. The motivation came from noticing performance issues with current solutions during music production work.

The initial work builds upon ideas and research started by Steven Atkinson, and is focused on exploring more efficient architectures and algorithms for real-time use.

## Project Goals
- Lower CPU overhead while maintaining usable tone quality.
- Explore amp modelling techniques:
  - Neural networks
  - Circuit simplification methods
  - Impulse response techniques

## Why
I started this project because many commercial and freeware amp sims were noticeably heavy on CPU, especially when using multiple instances in a project.

## Current Status
- Early prototyping phase.
- Using Python + TensorFlow/Keras for model experiments.
- Real-time performance testing pending.

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lightweight-amp-modelling
cd lightweight-amp-modelling
# Open notebook or run Python scripts
